## Dapper

  I have created a Generic Repository based in Dapper, approaching its philosophy to Entity Framework, 
removing the string queries far as possible, primarily for delete, update, insert and for All methods queries.

  I tried to create a custom library with comfort of Entity Framework and with performance of Dapper.
  I have tested ISqlData with Sql Server and it works fine.
